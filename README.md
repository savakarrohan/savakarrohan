### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ my name's Rohan. Whats yours?
-----------

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Thin Film dynamics, where I look to simulate and extract results from a thin film flowing down a heated cylinder.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning Quantum computing, to create better 'computers/calculators' to simulate real life situations using FEM for a start.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any of the above, or sports analytics and tactics used.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help for a lot of stuff, especially in learning to build a 3d printer.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about sports!! You will have to endure me breaking down most plays and why certain equipment is better than other.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: email me at <rohansavakar@gmail.com>

- âš¡ Fun fact: 
  - Rear wheels of a track cycle are usually disc type as their moment of inertia is lower.
  - If you pull back the strip on a crocs sandal to the back, **congratulation** you have now entered **sports mode**!
